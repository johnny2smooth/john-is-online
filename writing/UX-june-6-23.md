## Understanding Human Decision Making

It is crucial that a UX designer understands how users Analyze Info, Evaluate Alternatives, and Select a course of action based on their preferences, goals and desires. Once we are familiar with this process, we can create intuitive interfaces that help users make decisions.

### Factors Influencing Decision Making

- **Cognitive Biases** - Mental shortcuts that help us make decisions quickly. They are often based on our past experiences and can be helpful, but they can also lead to errors in judgement. Exampels include _anchoring bias_, _confirmation bias_, _bandwagon effect_, _sunk cost fallacy_, _status quo bias_, _loss aversion_, _choice overload_, _information bias_, _availability heuristic_, _recency bias_, _hindsight bias_, _optimism bias_, _overconfidence bias_, _self-serving bias_, _negativity bias_, _fundamental attribution error_, and much more.

- **Emotions** - Emotions can often guide the decision-making process. Although we may think that we are rational beings, our emotions can often override our intellect, hijacking the process in question. UX designers should be consider how an interface can invoke different emotions in users. UX designers should attempt to create interfaces that invoke positive emotions, such as joy, excitement, and happiness. Let's try to avoid invoking negative emotions, such as anger, frustration, and sadness.

- **Information Overload** - When users are presented with too much information, they can become overwhelmed and unable to make a decision. UX designers should attempt to present information in a way that is easy to digest and understand. We should also attempt to limit the amount of information that is presented to users at any given time. How can we present information in a digestible and accessible way?

### Decision Making Models

Understanding different decision-making models helps UX designers create interfaces that cater to various user needs and preferences. There are many different decision-making models, but we will focus on the following:

- **Compensatory Model** - This model assumes that users will evaluate all of the available options and choose the one that is the best overall. This model is often used when users are making a decision that is important to them. For example, if a user is purchasing a new car, they will likely evaluate all of the available options and choose the one that is the best overall. UX design implications include detailed information, filters, and comparisons. to help users make informed decisions.

- **Non-Compensatory Model** - Here, users employ a variety of heuristics or shortcuts to make decisions quickly. This model is often used when users are making a decision that is not important to them. For example, if a user is purchasing a new toothbrush, they will likely employ a variety of heuristics to make a decision quickly. UX design implications include simple interfaces, limited information, and a focus on the most important features. Highlight the key features and simplify the decision-making process.

- **Satisficing Model** - This model assumes that users will choose the first option that meets their needs. UX designers should consider implementing features like 'top choices' and recommendations to support this decision-making model.

### Design Principles for Supporting Decision Making

To enhance the decision-making experience, UX designers should consider the following design principles:

- **Progressibe Disclosure** - Present information gradually to avoid overwhelming users. This technique can include using tooltips, labels and expanding sections.

- **Cognitive Aids** - Helps users remember important information or tasks by providing timely reminders, notifications, and visual cues.

- **Feedback** - Provides users with information about the status of a task or process. This can include progress bars, loading indicators, and confirmation messages.

- **Defaults** - Defaults can help users make decisions in a context appropriate manner. This could look like a pre-filled form or suggested options.

Understanding human decision making and incorporating these principles into UX design will enable designers to create more intuitive, enjoyable, and efficient user experiences.

## Chat GPT's input on the subject matter

### Pyschological Factors that can Greatly Influence Decision Making

_Responses generated by Chat GPT_

1. **Heuristics**: These are mental shortcuts or "rules of thumb" that simplify decisions. For instance, people tend to stick with the default or status quo options when presented with a choice, a heuristic known as the "default effect" or "status quo bias". For example, when people are automatically enrolled in a retirement savings plan (the default option) they are more likely to participate than if they have to opt in. _Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky are the most influential figures in this area. They developed the concept of heuristics and biases. Their 1974 paper "Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases" is a seminal work in this field._

2. **Biases**: There are a variety of cognitive biases that can influence decision-making. For instance, the confirmation bias is the tendency to favor information that confirms our existing beliefs or hypotheses. A real-world example might be a person who is skeptical of climate change selectively focusing on colder days as evidence against global warming. _The aforementioned scholars Kahneman and Tversky also studied various cognitive biases extensively. Another key figure in the study of biases is Thomas Gilovich, who has conducted a significant amount of research on the subject._

3. **Emotions**: Emotions can have a powerful impact on decision making. They can both directly influence decisions and also color how we perceive our options. For instance, if you're in a bad mood, you might see your choices in a more negative light. An example could be a person feeling upset and deciding to make a large purchase to alleviate their feelings, often referred to as "retail therapy". _Antonio Damasio's somatic marker hypothesis has been influential in understanding the role of emotions in decision-making. Damasio's book "Descartes' Error" is a key work on this topic._

4. **Motivation**: The level of motivation one has can influence the decisions that they make. If someone is highly motivated, they may make decisions that align with their goals, while lower motivation may lead to procrastination or avoidance. An individual might be motivated to choose healthier food options if they have a goal of weight loss. _Edward Deci and Richard Ryan are key figures here. Their Self-Determination Theory has been influential in understanding intrinsic and extrinsic motivation._

5. **Cognitive Dissonance**: This refers to the mental discomfort that comes from holding two conflicting beliefs, values, or attitudes. People often change their attitudes or beliefs to reduce this discomfort. For example, if a person values environmental sustainability but also enjoys eating meat, they may experience cognitive dissonance. They might reduce this discomfort by deciding to eat less meat or switching to sustainably farmed products. _Leon Festinger is the key figure here. His 1957 book "A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance" is a foundational work in this area._

6. **Risk Perception**: The way individuals perceive risk can greatly influence their decision-making process. Some people are risk-averse and prefer safer options, while others are risk-tolerant and may opt for riskier choices if the potential reward is high enough. For instance, someone who perceives high risk in stock market may opt to invest in safer options like bonds, even though they might have a lower return. _Paul Slovic has done extensive research on risk perception. His work "Perception of Risk" (2000) would be a valuable resource._

7. **Social Influence**: Decisions can be heavily influenced by social factors, such as norms, peer pressure, and social comparison. For example, a person may decide to start smoking because they're in a social group where smoking is common and accepted. _Robert Cialdini is a leading researcher in this area, especially with respect to persuasion and influence. His book "Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion" is a seminal work in this field._

8. **Availability and Representativeness**: Availability refers to how immediate and easily conceived something is, which can skew our perception of its frequency or importance. Representativeness refers to judging the likelihood of an event based on how well it seems to represent, or match, specific prototypes. An example could be after seeing several news stories about shark attacks, a person may decide not to go swimming in the ocean due to an overestimated risk, even though shark attacks are actually extremely rare. _Availability and Representativeness: Again, Kahneman and Tversky's work is the most influential in this area._

9. **Framing Effects**: The way information is presented (its "frame") can significantly affect decisions. For instance, people are more likely to opt for a medical procedure if the survival rate is presented, compared to if the mortality rate is presented, even though both pieces of information are equivalent. This is an example of the positive frame being more persuasive than the negative frame. _Kahneman and Tversky also did foundational work in this area. Their paper "The Framing of Decisions and the Psychology of Choice" (1981) is a key reference._

10. **Overconfidence**: This refers to our tendency to overestimate our abilities or the accuracy of our beliefs. For example, drivers often think they're less likely to be involved in a car accident than other drivers, a bias that can lead to reckless driving behaviors. _Overconfidence has been studied by various researchers. One notable scholar is David Dunning (of the Dunning-Kruger effect fame). He has done extensive work on metacognition, which includes the study of overconfidence._

### Decision-Making Models

_Responses generated by Chat GPT_

1. **Rational Decision-Making Model**: This traditional model assumes that decision-makers have access to all the information, understand all alternatives and consequences, and will make the decision that provides maximum utility. While its assumptions are often criticized as being unrealistic, it provides a benchmark against which to compare other decision-making processes. Suppose you're looking to buy a car. You gather information about all available models, their features, prices, fuel efficiency, etc., and weigh them against your budget and needs. You choose the car that maximizes your utility or satisfaction based on these factors.

2. **Bounded Rationality Model**: Developed by Herbert Simon, this model suggests that people are not capable of obtaining all the information they would need to make a perfect decision. Instead, they make satisfactory decisions based on the information available within their cognitive boundaries or limits. Let's say you're deciding on a restaurant for dinner. You don't have time to research all possible options (as the rational model would suggest), so you pick a place that you know is good enough, based on your previous experiences or a friend's recommendation.

3. **Prospect Theory**: This is a behavioral model that shows how people decide between alternatives that involve risk, where the probabilities of outcomes are known. The theory, developed by Kahneman and Tversky, suggests that people make decisions based on potential gains and losses rather than final outcomes. Imagine you're offered a gamble on a coin toss. If it's heads, you lose $100, but if it's tails, you win $110. Despite the expected value being positive ($5), many people, according to Prospect Theory, would decline the gamble because the fear of losing $100 outweighs the potential gain of $110.

4. **Intuitive Decision-Making Model**: This model proposes that in many cases, people make decisions unconsciously using stored experiences and information. Gary Klein's Recognition-Primed Decision (RPD) model is a notable example, which suggests decision-makers can rapidly identify the situation and the course of action based on their past experiences. Consider a seasoned firefighter arriving at a burning building. Without conducting a thorough, methodical analysis of the situation, they make a quick decision based on their past experiences and gut feeling, ordering the team to evacuate moments before the building collapses. 

5. **Dual-Process Theory**: This model, which includes Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow theory, posits that we have two systems of thinking: System 1, which is fast, intuitive, and emotional; and System 2, which is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Suppose you're deciding whether to buy a house. Your System 1 thinking might be attracted to the house because it has a beautiful garden (a quick, emotional reaction). However, your System 2 thinking steps in to carefully consider the financial implications of this decision (slow, logical analysis).

6. **Polis Model**: This model suggests that decision-making is a social process that must be studied within its sociopolitical context. It considers decision-making as a discussion-based process that involves multiple actors with different interests. For instance, a city council deciding whether to build a new park in the city. The councilors discuss the idea, each bringing in their perspectives, interests, and the interests of their constituents. The decision emerges from these discussions and negotiations.

7. **Incremental Model (or Muddling Through)**: This model, proposed by Charles Lindblom, suggests that decisions are made through a process of iteration and small improvements on the existing situation, rather than through completely new solutions. Consider a government's approach to improving healthcare. Instead of a complete system overhaul, the government may implement changes gradually, such as expanding existing healthcare programs, increasing funding for hospitals incrementally, etc.

8. **Garbage Can Model**: This model, proposed by Cohen, March, and Olsen, suggests that decision-making in organizations is random and problems, solutions, and participants are disconnected. A tech startup facing multiple challenges may function like this. They might have several problems (need for funding, product development issues) and several solutions (new product features, partnership offers) floating around, and connections between problems and solutions happen somewhat randomly.

9. **Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT)**: This decision-making model weighs various factors based on their importance to the decision-maker. It's useful when multiple criteria need consideration. Imagine a business deciding on a location for its new branch. The decision involves multiple factors, like rent, proximity to customers, availability of staff, etc. The business assigns importance (weight) to each factor, rates the potential locations on each factor, and selects the location with the highest overall score.

10. **Cynefin Framework**: Developed by Dave Snowden, this model helps decision-makers understand the complexity of different types of problems and the best way to approach them. In a crisis management situation, leaders often use this model. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, governments across the globe had to make decisions in a "complex" domain where cause and effect relationships were unclear. Decisions had to be made based on emerging patterns and with an acceptance of the complexity and uncertainty inherent in the situation.

### Design Principles for Supporting Decision Making

Prompt: _Give me a list of  psychological principles for supporting Decision-Making. Explain each topic within the list and provide real world examples for each topic. Are there any studies or specific scholars in these subject area that you can point me towards as further reference?_

1. **Anchoring Bias**: Anchoring is a cognitive bias where an individual depends too heavily on an initial piece of information offered (the "anchor") when making decisions. During decision making, anchoring occurs when individuals use an initial piece of information to make subsequent judgments.

Example: When negotiating a price, the first number put on the table sets the tone for the rest of the negotiation. So, a car salesman will suggest a high price as an anchor to make subsequent price adjustments seem like a good deal.

Scholar: Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman have done significant work in the area of anchoring bias.

2. **The Paradox of Choice**: This principle suggests that too many choices can lead to decision fatigue and regret of options not taken.

Example: In a grocery store, when there are too many varieties of jam or butter to choose from, the customer may end up not buying anything due to the overwhelming number of options.

Scholar: Barry Schwartz is known for his work on the Paradox of Choice. His book by the same name delves deep into this concept.

3. **Loss Aversion**: People prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. We are more upset about losing $50 than we are happy about gaining $50.

Example: In investing, people often hold on to losing stocks for too long, and sell winning stocks too soon because they are more distressed about the potential loss than they are excited about making a gain.

Scholars: Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky are the pioneers of this concept, which is part of their Prospect Theory.

4. **Availability Heuristic**: People tend to heavily weigh their judgments toward more recent information, making new opinions biased toward that latest news.

Example: After seeing news stories about car thefts, people might incorrectly believe that car theft is far more common than it really is in their area.

Scholars: The concept of availability heuristic was also first introduced by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman.

5. **Confirmation Bias**: This is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses.

Example: If an individual believes that left-handed people are more creative than right-handed people, they would be more likely to notice left-handed people in creative professions and ignore or forget instances that don't fit their hypothesis.

Scholars: Peter Wason is one of the psychologists who has contributed significantly to studies on confirmation bias.

6. **Framing Effect**: People react differently depending on whether the same information is presented in a positive or negative light.

Example: If a doctor says a procedure has a 90% success rate, people are more likely to agree to it than if the doctor says it has a 10% failure rate.

Scholars: The concept of framing effect is also associated with Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman.

7. **Sunk Cost Fallacy**: This is the tendency to continue an endeavor once an investment in money, effort, or time has been made, often leading to irrational decision-making.

Example: Even if a project is clearly doomed or not delivering as expected, people may continue investing in it because they consider the resources already invested. They don't want to 'waste' what's already been spent, even if it means losing more.

Scholar: Hal Arkes and Catherine Blumer conducted a significant study on the sunk cost fallacy in 1985, which is often referred to in the discussion of this topic.

8. **Recency Bias**: This bias occurs when we give undue weight to recent events or experiences. We tend to remember and be influenced more by what happened most recently than by earlier events.

Example: Investors might judge the performance of their investment portfolio based on the past few months rather than the overall trend over many years. This can lead to rash decisions, like pulling out of an investment after a short period of poor performance.

Scholar: Recency bias is often discussed in the context of behavioral finance, a field popularized by scholars like Richard Thaler.

9. **Status Quo Bias**: This is an emotional bias; a preference for the current state of affairs. The current baseline (or status quo) is taken as a reference point, and any change from that baseline is perceived as a loss.

Example: When renewing subscriptions or contracts, people often stick with their current provider, even if there could be better options available. They prefer the familiar and avoid the effort of change.

Scholars: William Samuelson and Richard Zeckhauser introduced the concept of status quo bias in a 1988 paper.

10. **Hindsight Bias**: Also known as the "knew-it-all-along" effect, this bias tends to make events seem more predictable after they've happened. It can lead to an oversimplification of cause and effect and can also result in overconfidence in the accuracy of our predictions.

Example: After a significant event like an election result or a surprising sports match outcome, people often believe they "knew it all along", even though the result was uncertain or even unlikely before the event.

Scholar: Psychologist Baruch Fischhoff is well-known for his work in understanding hindsight bias.

These psychological principles help us understand why we sometimes make irrational or suboptimal decisions. For further reference, you may want to explore the works of the scholars mentioned along with the respective principles. Daniel Kahneman's book "Thinking, Fast and Slow" is a highly recommended read in this domain.
