## Understanding Human Decision Making

It is crucial that a UX designer understands how users Analyze Info, Evaluate Alternatives, and Select a course of action based on their preferences, goals and desires. Once we are familiar with this process, we can create intuitive interfaces that help users make decisions.

### Factors Influencing Decision Making

- **Cognitive Biases** - Mental shortcuts that help us make decisions quickly. They are often based on our past experiences and can be helpful, but they can also lead to errors in judgement. Exampels include _anchoring bias_, _confirmation bias_, _bandwagon effect_, _sunk cost fallacy_, _status quo bias_, _loss aversion_, _choice overload_, _information bias_, _availability heuristic_, _recency bias_, _hindsight bias_, _optimism bias_, _overconfidence bias_, _self-serving bias_, _negativity bias_, _fundamental attribution error_, and much more.

- **Emotions** - Emotions can often guide the decision-making process. Although we may think that we are rational beings, our emotions can often override our intellect, hijacking the process in question. UX designers should be consider how an interface can invoke different emotions in users. UX designers should attempt to create interfaces that invoke positive emotions, such as joy, excitement, and happiness. Let's try to avoid invoking negative emotions, such as anger, frustration, and sadness.

- **Information Overload** - When users are presented with too much information, they can become overwhelmed and unable to make a decision. UX designers should attempt to present information in a way that is easy to digest and understand. We should also attempt to limit the amount of information that is presented to users at any given time. How can we present information in a digestible and accessible way?

### Decision Making Models

Understanding different decision-making models helps UX designers create interfaces that cater to various user needs and preferences. There are many different decision-making models, but we will focus on the following:

- **Compensatory Model** - This model assumes that users will evaluate all of the available options and choose the one that is the best overall. This model is often used when users are making a decision that is important to them. For example, if a user is purchasing a new car, they will likely evaluate all of the available options and choose the one that is the best overall. UX design implications include detailed information, filters, and comparisons. to help users make informed decisions.

- **Non-Compensatory Model** - Here, users employ a variety of heuristics or shortcuts to make decisions quickly. This model is often used when users are making a decision that is not important to them. For example, if a user is purchasing a new toothbrush, they will likely employ a variety of heuristics to make a decision quickly. UX design implications include simple interfaces, limited information, and a focus on the most important features. Highlight the key features and simplify the decision-making process.

- **Satisficing Model** - This model assumes that users will choose the first option that meets their needs. UX designers should consider implementing features like 'top choices' and recommendations to support this decision-making model.

### Design Principles for Supporting Decision Making

To enhance the decision-making experience, UX designers should consider the following design principles:

- **Progressibe Disclosure** - Present information gradually to avoid overwhelming users. This technique can include using tooltips, labels and expanding sections.

- **Cognitive Aids** - Helps users remember important information or tasks by providing timely reminders, notifications, and visual cues.

- **Feedback** - Provides users with information about the status of a task or process. This can include progress bars, loading indicators, and confirmation messages.

- **Defaults** - Defaults can help users make decisions in a context appropriate manner. This could look like a pre-filled form or suggested options.

Understanding human decision making and incorporating these principles into UX design will enable designers to create more intuitive, enjoyable, and efficient user experiences.
