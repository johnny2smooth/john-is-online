# Today's notes

June 6th, 2023

I purchased [CAPS LOCK](https://valiz.nl/en/publications/caps-lock) yesterday at Elliot Bay Books. It is awesome so far. It also came with some [instructional materials](https://valiz.nl/images/publicaties/CAPS_LOCK/CAPS_LOCK_EDUCATIONALTOOLKIT.pdf) which I will add to the curriuculum.

## Overview 

Most UX frameworks rely on a profound understanding the human psyche. Once we are familiar with what our users motivations and abilities, we create a product that caters to them in every way possible so that they stay on the site longer, spend money, and come back again to spend more money. Something that was very interesting is that B.J. Fogg's _Behavioral Design Lab_ was once called the _Persuasive Tech Lab_. There is a whole page dedicated to [The Ethical Use of Persuasive Technology](https://behaviordesign.stanford.edu/ethical-use-persuasive-technology) on their website, implying that there are dangers of using pursuasive technologies. Congrats BJ, you've made it to the curriculum.

## Frameworks

### BJ Fogg's Behavoir Model

B.J. Fogg, a renowned _psychologist_ and founder of the Persuasive Tech Lab at Stanford University, proposed the Fogg Behavior Model. This model revolves around the three tenets of motivation, ability, and triggers.

- **Motivation**: Motivation refers to the level of desire one has to perform a given behavior. The stronger the motivation, the more likely it is that the person will undertake the behavior. Fogg identifies three core motivators: sensation (pleasure/pain), anticipation (hope/fear), and belonging (social acceptance/rejection). Motivation can be difficult to influence, as it is often deeply rooted in individual values and experiences.

Real-world example: A person might be motivated to exercise regularly because they anticipate the benefits (hope) such as better health, weight loss, and improved mood. The pain of potential health issues if they do not exercise might also motivate them.

- **Ability**: This refers to how easy or hard it is for someone to perform a behavior. If a behavior is easy to do, there's a higher chance that the person will do it. Ability is affected by six factors: time, money, physical effort, brain cycles (mental effort), social deviance (going against the norm), and non-routine (how much the behavior deviates from current routine). Designers often focus on making the behavior easier to perform to increase the likelihood that it will occur.

Real-world example: A food delivery app increases a user's ability to order food by simplifying the ordering process. With saved favorite meals, multiple payment options, and user-friendly interface, the app removes a lot of the hassle involved in traditional ordering, making it very easy for the user to order food.

- **Prompt(Triggers)**: The prompt is the cue or call to action that initiates the behavior. A prompt should be noticeable and associated with the behavior. It can be an external or internal cue. For a prompt to succeed, the person must have sufficient motivation and ability. Without a prompt, the desired behavior is unlikely to occur, even with high levels of motivation and ability.

Real-world example: A phone alarm ringing in the morning serves as a prompt to wake up. If a person has sufficient motivation (e.g., needing to get to work on time) and ability (e.g., they went to bed early enough to get sufficient sleep), then the alarm will likely be successful in prompting the person to wake up.

### Stephen Wendell's CREATE Action Funnel

Stephen Wendel is a behavioral scientist and the head of Behvaioral Science at Morningstar, an investment research company. The Action Funnel is focused on converting website visitors into active customers through a _systematic_ and _engaging process_. The emphasis of this approach is to understand user behavior, cater to their needs and direct them towards specific actions. The _Action Funnel_ consists of four major steps: Cue, Reaction, Evaluation, Ability Check and Time Pressure.

### Spectrum of Thinking Interventions

Used to identify the types and range of thinking interventions that the user may require. This spectrum encompasses four primary categories: guidance, explanation, exploration, and creation.

Guidance-based interventions are designed to help users navigate through a digital product or service with minimal effort. They may be aimed at full-fledged beginners, casual users, or experts in their respective domains. Such interventions may include signposts, tooltips, and clearly articulated labels.

Explanation-based interventions provide users with detailed narratives, overviews, or background information that helps them make informed decisions. This may include tutorials, articles, videos, or any other mediums that help explain complex concepts or instructions.

Exploration-based interventions encourage users to understand and interact with the product by investigating, asking questions, or searching for solutions on their own. This can be done by providing interactive elements, multiple pathways, and opportunities for discovery.

Creation-based interventions engage users by offering them the tools and resources to co-create or customize their experience. This type of intervention often involves a more extensive level of input and involvement from the user as they become active participants in the design process.

 Always consider how these interventions will influence usersâ€™ decision-making processes and their overall satisfaction with your digital product or service.

### Dual Process Theory

The Dual Process Theory, popularized by psychologist Daniel Kahneman in his book "Thinking, Fast and Slow," suggests that our cognitive processing isn't one unified whole, but rather a system of two parts working together. The Dual Process Theory proposes two distinct systems for processing information: System 1 and System 2. These systems help us make decisions, form judgments, and solve problems, but they do so in very different ways.

System 1: Often referred to as the 'automatic' system, System 1 operates quickly with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control. It's driven by instinct and intuition, and it is capable of simple automatic processes and learned associations. System 1 also handles tasks that are so well learned that they've become automatic, such as recognizing faces or driving a car on an empty road. However, because System 1 relies on mental shortcuts and associations, it's more prone to bias and errors in judgment.

Real-world example: Suppose you're walking down the street and you see a snake in your path. Your immediate reaction of fear and your instinct to step away happen automatically, before you even have time to think about it. That's System 1 at work.

System 2: Often referred to as the 'reflective' system, System 2 involves slower, more deliberate, and more effortful processing. This system is typically involved in complex calculations, critical thinking, and decision-making. System 2 requires conscious effort and mental energy to use. It can override System 1 when we're aware of its input and decide to question it.

Real-world example: If you're considering buying a house, you would engage System 2 to evaluate the property, consider the price, assess the location, plan for financing, and more. These tasks require conscious effort, deliberation, and complex reasoning.

In order to create user experiences that cater to both System 1 and System 2 thinking, UX designers should:

- Make tasks simple and intuitive: Reduce cognitive load by simplifying tasks, using familiar patterns, and providing clear instructions.

- Provide visual cues: Use visual cues such as icons, colors, and typography to guide users through tasks, while promoting clarity and efficiency.

- Minimize errors: Design systems that help prevent errors by using constraints, providing feedback, and allowing users to undo their actions.

- Accommodate different thinking styles: Recognize that different users may approach tasks using different cognitive styles, and design experiences that cater to a range of preferences.

- Test and iterate: Continuously test your designs with real users, and iterate based on their feedback to ensure that your designs are catering to both System 1 and System 2 thinking.

By understanding the Dual Process Theory and designing for both types of cognitive processing, UX designers can create user experiences that are both delightful and efficient, ultimately leading to higher user satisfaction and engagement.
