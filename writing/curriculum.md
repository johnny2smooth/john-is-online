## Approach

I have been teaching myself how to code and how to learn for a couple of years now. I've found that I have to rely on my own curriculum to stay on track. I have a tendency to get distracted by the next shiny thing. I am hoping that by writing down my curriculum, I will be able to stay on track and not get distracted by the next shiny thing (although this is unlikely). But regardless, I am writing out a plan to combat this. I will tackle one topic at a time per day. I will spend an hour or two on each topic, and investigate beyond the provided resources when necessary. I do not have a deadline to finish any topic, but I will be keeping track of my progress in this repository. I know that if I chip away at each subject matter, I'll eventually get to where I want to be.

Learning how to learn has taught me that the two most important aspects of solidifying your knowledge in a topics are to practice **spaced repititon** and **active recall**. I will be using [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) to help me with this. I am horrible at staying on track with my flashcards, so I will be using my notes to be the foundation for videos that I will film on the subject. I am hoping that the videos will serves as a heat-seeking missile type rock that has a bloodthirst for killing multiple birds in one time.

### John's End of the Day Notes

**UX**: 6-6-23 

_I have decided that it will be better to focus on one topic at a time during this summer course. I want to dive deeply into the subject matter for consecutive days at a time so that I'm able to create a space for it in my brain. So instead of having different courses, I will ammend this document to tackle one topic at a time, but I will include materials that I can cross off instead. I am adding [CAPS LOCK](https://valiz.nl/images/publicaties/CAPS_LOCK/CAPS_LOCK_EDUCATIONALTOOLKIT.pdf) to my list of materials that will supplement this UX journey.

**UX**: 6-5-23 

_From my priliminary reading of Roadmap's overview of UX, I have come to the conclusion that a UX designer's main function is to manipulate the user. We live in a world of wealth extraction and a UX designer finds their purpose in lubrating that transaction through empathy, understanding, and support._
